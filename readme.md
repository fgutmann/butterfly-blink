#  Butterfly Blink

Do you have issues with dry and red eyes? Especially when working for a long time on the computer?
Often the reason for this is that you just forget to blink while working on the screen!

This little tool helps you to remind to blink your eyes while working on the screen.
Every 10 seconds the screen will "blink" to remind you to blink your eyes.

# How to use it

Try to blink every time the screen blinks. But don't limit yourself to only blink when your screen tells you to. Feel free to blink as often as you want in the meantime.

Don't blink very hard, try to have a gentle blink! You shouldn't feel your lids touching at all. Even if you only do a half-blink it will help your eyes to stay moisturized. Try to have a "butterfly blink".

# Installing & Running

Currently this app is a very rough prototype to test if it actually helps to improve blinking habits.
There is no installer, or binary available for now.

Open the app in xcode and just run it. Watch your screen and you to start to blink.

# TODO

Make it a nice binary,  with a system tray icon and a small settings dialog.

system tray options:

- Enabled (check mark)
- Settings
- Quit

settings dialog:

- blink interval
- blink duration
- blink intensity
- blink color
- checkbox - launch on system start

# Contributing

I'm very happy to accept any pull request that helps to make it useful to a wider audience.
Contributions to work on points in the TODO list are very welcome.
